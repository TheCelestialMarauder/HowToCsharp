# Learning C#

Welcome to the "Learning C#" repository! This is a personal project aimed at improving my skills in C# programming by working on different exercises, projects, and tutorials.

## Overview

This repository is divided into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of C# programming:

- **Basics**: Simple programs that cover fundamental C# syntax, data types, control structures, and functions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Examples and exercises focused on OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more.
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of basic data structures like arrays, lists, stacks, queues, and dictionaries.
- **Algorithms**: Solutions to common algorithmic problems, including sorting, searching, and recursive algorithms.
- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: Practice exercises using LINQ for data manipulation.
- **Advanced Concepts**: Exploring advanced topics such as delegates, events, exception handling, and asynchronous programming.
- **Projects**: Small projects or applications built to consolidate what I've learned.
- **Notes**: Written notes or markdown files summarizing key concepts, tips, and resources.

## How to Use This Repository

- **For Beginners**: Start by exploring the `Basics` folder, where you can learn the syntax and fundamental concepts of C#. Each folder contains self-contained examples and explanations.
- **For Intermediate Learners**: Dive into the `OOP`, `Data Structures`, and `Algorithms` sections. These will challenge you with more complex problems and concepts.
- **For Everyone**: Feel free to explore the `Projects` section to see how these concepts are applied in real-world scenarios.
